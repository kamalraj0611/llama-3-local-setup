# Feed Your Required Documents to a Local Large Language Model!

## Introduction

In this guide, we'll explore how to enhance large language models by uploading your own documents and files. This process can be applied both locally and online, allowing you to customize the model's knowledge base to better suit your needs. We will delve into three primary methods for integrating additional knowledge: retraining the model, utilizing retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and uploading documents directly into the context window.

## Overview of Methods

1. **Retraining the Model**: This process involves teaching the model new information by providing it with updated lessons and resources. However, it requires significant computational power, time, and resources.

2. **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Instead of permanently modifying the model, RAG allows the model to dynamically retrieve relevant information from an external database or document pool, crafting responses based on up-to-date sources.

3. **Uploading Documents**: This method involves providing the model with temporary reference documents that it can consult during a session. However, the model will not retain this information once the session ends.

## Adding Information to Large Language Models

### Retraining the Model

Retraining a model is like back to square one. It requires access to the model's weights and significant hardware resources, making it impractical for many users.

### Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

RAG functions like a person who knows where to find information. It allows the model to pull relevant data from external sources quickly. This approach is agile and efficient for handling large datasets without the need for retraining.

### Uploading Documents to the Context Window

Imagine having a conversation where you can refer to your notes. By uploading documents to the model's context window, you provide it with the information needed to answer your questions during the session.

#### Uploading Documents in ChatGPT

1. **Access the Upload Feature**: In ChatGPT, look for the upload button to attach documents.
2. **Select Files**: Choose the documents from your local computer to upload.
3. **Ask Questions**: After uploading, ask the model specific questions that reference the uploaded documents.

For example, after uploading a manual, you can inquire about specific instructions, and the model will provide answers based on the content of the uploaded file.

### Creating a Custom GPT

To create a custom GPT with your context documents baked in:

1. Go to the **Explore GPTs** section.
2. Click **Create** and fill in the necessary details, including a name and purpose for your custom GPT.
3. Upload your files, and once done, create your custom model.
4. You can then interact with your custom GPT and ask specific questions.

### Using Local Models with Open Web UI

If you're running models locally (e.g., using LLaMA):

1. Upload documents through the Open Web UI.
2. Ask specific questions that require reference to the uploaded materials.
3. The model will generate accurate answers and reference the context document.

## Conclusion

Integrating your own knowledge files into a large language model can significantly enhance its performance and relevance. Depending on your needs, choose between retraining, using RAG, or simply uploading documents. Each method has its strengths and can be tailored to various applications.

### Final Thoughts

Whether you are building a custom GPT or leveraging a local model, the ability to provide specific context makes the interaction more productive. Experiment with these methods to find the best fit for your requirements!
